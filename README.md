# Nudjed.com

To get started, clone the project and install the dependencies:

```
# Using npm
npm install

# Using Yarn
yarn
```

After that, start up Webpack:

```
./node_modules/.bin/webpack --watch
```

Webpack will watch `/src/styles.css` and `/tailwind.js` and rebuild your stylesheet on every change.

You can play around with `/index.html` to see the effects of your changes.
